In this update, the ATOM host mode is replaced by A "ALLCC#" Host mode. Press A and power on the device will enter this mode.

In this mode, all 1 to 4 and A to Z are used as CC# commands. Each 8 keys are assigned as different CC# numbers. 8 banks can be selected by + and - keys. 

Bank1: CC1 to CC8 (1,2,3,4,A,B,C,D)
Bank2: CC9 to CC16 (1,2,3,4,A,B,C,D)
...
Bank8: CC57 to CC64 (1,2,3,4,A,B,C,D)

Note that no toggling function of the CC# commands availble in this mode. In most cases, the host software can receive and toggle the state totally in the software side.

Also the EXP function was calibrated to meet most Exp pedals to reach from 0 to 127 output.

Thank you!
